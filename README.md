# Blitz-Checkers
Small Project for Software Engineering I

This game is a spin on the classic game of Checkers. Our game adds a Blitz element (akin to Blitz Chess).

It was written using https://thepythoncode.com/article/make-a-checkers-game-with-pygame-in-python#the-board-class for the main structure of the game.

We added custom pieces and the timer element.

## Dependencies to install:
    pip install pygame

## To run the game:

    python Main.py
